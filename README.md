# vmHilt

Have added another readme file in app/src/main/java/com/hk/vmhilt/readme.kt (Please check)

Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides.

Dependency injection provides your app with the following advantages:
-> Reusability of classes and decoupling of dependencies: It's easier to swap out implementations of a dependency. Code reuse is improved because of inversion of control, and      	 classes no longer control how their dependencies are created, but instead work with any configuration.

-> Ease of refactoring: The dependencies become a verifiable part of the API surface, so they can be checked at object-creation time or at compile time rather than being hidden as    implementation details.

-> Ease of testing: A class doesn't manage its dependencies, so when you're testing it, you can pass in different implementations to test all of your different cases.
